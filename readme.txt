Growth fitting
Microbial growth fitting pipeline first reported in Darnell and Schmid, 2015 "Systems biology approaches to defining archaeal transcription regulatory networks." Uses Gompertz and logistic regression to fit microbial growth curve data. 
* This repository contains the code necessary calculate microbial growth parameters (maximum instantaneous growth rate, carrying capacity, lag time) from 96-well microplate reader growth curves.
* Example raw data are available in:
o Schmid et al., 2011, Nucleic Acids Research, 39(7): 2519-2533, Supplementary Table 1.
o Sharma et al., 2012, BMC Genomics, 31:351, Additional File 3. 
* Original equations for calculations derived from Zwietering et al., 1990, Appl Env Microbiol, 56: 1875-1881.
Dependencies
* MatLab (version 8.5)
To run
* See instructions and use commands in “run.m” in this repository.
